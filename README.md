# Python Assignment

## Introduction

Python is a high-level, easy-to-read programming language created to make coding simple and efficient. It is widely used in economics, finance, business analytics, and research. Python helps process data, build models, and visualize trends, making it very useful for economic analysis.

## Key Concepts

- Python uses **simple and readable syntax**
- It is an **interpreted language** (runs code line by line)
- Supports different programming styles:
  - Procedural
  - Object-oriented
  - Functional
- Important libraries used in economics:
  - NumPy (mathematics)
  - Pandas (data handling)
  - Matplotlib (visualization)

## Simple Syntax Examples

```python
x = 10
numbers = [1, 2, 3]

if x > 5:
    print("Greater")

for i in numbers:
    print(i)
```

## Real-Life or Business Use Case

Python plays an important role in economics and business decision-making.

Economists and analysts use Python to:

- Analyze GDP growth and national income data  
- Predict inflation and market trends  
- Study unemployment and labor statistics  
- Visualize financial market movements  
- Manage and clean large government datasets  

For example, a researcher studying economic growth can use Python to organize raw data, remove errors, and prepare it for analysis.

## Advantages

- **Easy to learn** because of simple English-like syntax  
- **Time-saving** due to short and readable code  
- **Large community support** and learning resources  
- **Useful in multiple fields** like economics, finance, AI, and research  
- **Works on all operating systems** (Windows, Mac, Linux)

---

## Limitations

- Slower compared to languages like C++  
- Not mainly used for mobile app development  
- Can use more memory in large applications  
- Performance may reduce in very complex systems
